# Yunipals TCG

Welcome to the **Yunipals TCG** repository! This project aims to create a Telegram-based monster-collectible game with an innovative merging system that transforms duplicate pulls into exciting new evolutions.

## Current Status

We’re in an **early alpha** stage, focusing on:
- Revising the core loop (booster acquisition, opening, and merging)
- Streamlining meta progression (collection, Flex Battles, leaderboard)
- Setting up a basic recurring event for live operations

## Latest Community Update

We’ve published our first blog-style update detailing the new core loop, meta progression, and the short term development plan.
