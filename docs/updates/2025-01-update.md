# Yunipals TCG: Community Update #1

Hello Yunipals community,

First off, **thank you** for participating in our alpha phase and sharing your thoughts. We’ve also gathered insights from various external test sessions to refine our approach. Our main goals in this update are to **improve retention**, **streamline the core loop**, and **enhance meta progression**. Below is a rundown of the changes and why they matter.

---

## 1. New Core Loop

### Acquire Boosters
- **Time-Based**: You’ll regularly receive free boosters over time as a fundamental gameplay mechanic.  
- **Speed-Ups**: There will be options to increase your booster recharge rate or open more boosters if you’re eager to progress faster.

### Open Boosters
- **Single Pulls**: Each pack contains exactly one monster.  
- **Duplicates**: Extra copies are never wasted—they’re essential for merging and evolution.

### Merge Duplicates
- **Gacha-Like Mechanic**: Merging five duplicates of the same monster type yields a random evolution (Mutant, Shadow, Cyborg, or Crystal).  
- **Surprise Factor**: There’s a “jackpot” thrill when you land an ultra-rare form.

**Why This Matters**  
- **Excitement Loops**: Opening boosters feels rewarding, and merging provides a satisfying long-term goal.  
- **Retention Boost**: Regular logins mean more boosters, more merges, and more chances at rare evolutions.

## 2. New Meta Progression Highlights

### Collection Building
- **Sets & Milestones**: Filling out certain monster sets unlocks special variants (e.g., Rainbow evolutions) or extra perks.

### Flex Battles (PvP)
- **Pop-Up Duels**: After opening a pack, you might be pulled into a quick battle with another player’s collection.  
- **High Rarity Advantage**: Rare monsters significantly boost your odds of winning.

### Leaderboard (Light Version)
- **Evolutions Count**: Showcases how many merges you’ve done and your highest-rarity monsters.  
- **Future Plans**: We may explore league divisions or seasonal resets to keep competition lively.

### Mutant Monday (LiveOps Event)
- **Weekly Bonus**: Slightly higher odds to evolve Mutant forms on Mondays.  
- **Experimenting**: Potentially fewer duplicates needed (e.g., only four) to evolve Mutants during the event.

## 3. Development Plan: Stage 1

### High-Level Goals
1. **Enhance Core Loop**  
   - Revised booster acquisition, single-pack openings, and merging mechanics.

3. **Launch a Basic Event**  
   - “Mutant Monday” as a simple weekly test to assess our LiveOps framework.
4. **Player Activity Logging**  
   - Track merges, pack openings, and event participation to guide future decisions.
5. **Strealime features**  
   - Removal of messages, feeding and mini game (for now).
